1. Introduction to Modular Arithmetic and Secret Generation in Cryptography

1.1 What is Modulo (mod)?

The modulus operation finds the remainder when one number is divided by another.

Format:
a mod n = r

Where 'a' is the number being divided

'n' is the divisor

'r' is the remainder



Examples:

1. 7 mod 3 = 1

7 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 1

So, 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3)



2. 81 mod 7 = 4

81 ÷ 7 = 11 remainder 4




1.2 Fermat's Little Theorem

Used extensively in modular arithmetic for cryptographic applications.

Theorem:
For any prime p and integer a (not divisible by p):

a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)

2. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

2.1 Purpose

The Diffie-Hellman protocol allows two parties to securely exchange a shared secret over an insecure channel without transmitting the secret directly.

2.2 How It Works

1. Alice and Bob agree on two public values:

g (base) and p (a large prime).



2. Each party generates a private key:

Alice: a

Bob: b



3. Alice computes A = g^a mod p and sends A to Bob.


4. Bob computes B = g^b mod p and sends B to Alice.


5. Both compute the shared secret using the other party's public value:

Alice: s = B^a mod p
Bob: s = A^b mod p

Since modular exponentiation is commutative:

g^(a * b) mod p = g^(b * a) mod p



Use Case:

This shared secret can be used to derive encryption keys for secure communication between the two parties.

3. Python’s pow() Function

The pow() function in Python is used for modular exponentiation, which is critical in cryptographic protocols.

Syntax:

pow(base, exp, mod)

base: The number to be raised.

exp: The exponent.

mod: The modulus (optional).


When provided with a modulus, pow() efficiently computes (base^exp) % mod using optimized algorithms.

Example:

result = pow(3, 5, 7)  # 3^5 % 7 = 5
print(result)  # Output: 5

4. Explanation of the CTF Script

4.1 Original Script Breakdown

#!/usr/bin/env python
from Crypto.Util.number import getStrongPrime
from random import randint
from hashlib import sha256

g = 3
p = getStrongPrime(1024)  # Generates a strong prime (1024 bits)
secret = randint(2**1023, 2**1024)  # Random secret between 2^1023 and 2^1024

print(f'g = {g}')
print(f'p = {p}')
print(f'secret = {secret}')

user_secret = int(input('Enter your secret: '))

user_shared = pow(g, user_secret, p)
shared = pow(g, secret, p)

if sha256(str(user_shared).encode()).digest() == sha256(str(shared).encode()).digest():
    print("Well done, here is your flag!")
else:
    print("No flag for you!")

4.2 Key Concept:

The core task is to guess or derive the user_secret such that:

pow(g, user_secret, p) == pow(g, secret, p)

---

5. How to Derive user_secret

Since g^(secret) mod p and g^(user_secret) mod p produce the same result, user_secret must satisfy:

user_secret ≡ secret (mod p - 1)

Thus:

user_secret = secret + k(p - 1)

where k is any integer.

---

Modified Script Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from Crypto.Util.number import getStrongPrime
from random import randint

g = 3
p = getStrongPrime(1024)
secret = randint(2**1023, 2**1024)

# Correct user_secret calculation
k = 1  # Example value
user_secret = secret + k * (p - 1)

print(f'g = {g}')
print(f'p = {p}')
print(f'Use this user_secret: {user_secret}')

---

6. Using the pwn Library

pwn is a library used in CTF challenges, especially for binary exploitation and networking tasks. It allows interaction with remote services, process manipulation, and memory exploration.

Basic Example:

from pwn import *

conn = remote('host5.metaproblems.com', 7050)  # Connect to the server
conn.recvline()  # Receive a line from the server
conn.sendline(b'Hello')  # Send 'Hello' as bytes
print(conn.recvall())  # Print all received data

---

7. Final Solution Using pwn

Here’s the complete CTF solution:

from pwn import *
conn = remote('host5.metaproblems.com', 7050)

# Receive and execute lines to get values from the server
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
exec(conn.recvline())  # g = 3
exec(conn.recvline())  # p = ...
exec(conn.recvline())  # secret = ...

# Calculate the payload to solve the challenge
payload = str(secret + (p - 1)).encode()  # Encode the solution
conn.sendlineafter(b'secret: ', payload)  # Send it to the server

print(conn.recvall())  # Print the response (flag)

Explanation:

str(secret + (p - 1)).encode():
The payload converts the calculated user_secret to bytes for transmission.

b'secret: ':
The b prefix ensures the string is treated as bytes, which is required when sending data over sockets.
